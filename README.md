HChess
======

Learning Haskell by writing a chess simulator.

The board will allow for any number of teams and any size of rectangular board.

So far I've only written tests for all pieces. It handles *en passant* but not yet Castling or Promotion. Moves aren't valid if it places your own king in check. That's about it so far.

Eventually this will have a console UI so you can see possible moves and eventually play a game. Looking farther ahead, I want to program some opponents that play using different strategies.
